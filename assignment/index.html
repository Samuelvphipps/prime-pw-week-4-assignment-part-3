    <h1>Week 4 Assignment - Part 3</h1>
    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My main question regarding functions is about returning a value. For example in assignment part three, there were questions requiring 
        logged outputs (specifically the listItem function). I also added in a return so that it wouldnt return undefined if it was ran in console or included in another function. Is this something
        that is necessary? Or is this just something that can be done if its wanted?
      </li>
      <li>
        When I first went through this assignment I was adding parameters 
        specifying "array". I have since gone through and removed them 
        since it makes it cleaner and easier to follow as all functions 
        pertain to basket. I assume when creating an entire program it makes sense
        to have global functions that can be applied to all arrays, 
        are there times where this isnt the case?

        <em> example is for my removed item function. I originally wrote it as removedItem(array, item) but have changed it to removedItem(item)</em>
